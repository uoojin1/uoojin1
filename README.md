# Hi, there!

My name is Eugene (or Yujin) and I'm a software developer currently living in Toronto, Canada.

I'm currently with [Included Health](includedhealth.com), working towards making health care better for everyone.

Today, I'm at [Included Health](https://includedhealth.com/) and we are on a mission to make health care better for everyone. I sought a role that allowed me to delve deeper into Golang (a language I love) and play a central role within a core team. The Orchestration Platform team within IncludedHealth's Infrastructure org perfectly aligns with these aspirations. Here in my team, we build a healthcare orchestration engine for other vertical teams. My manager's insights during our coffee chat ultimately sealed the deal. I'm excited to learn from him and the team.

Below are the things that I focus on:

 **Deepening My Go Expertise**: I'm eager to strengthen my foundation in Go and its ecosystem. If you have any recommendations for excellent resources please don't hesitate to share them.
- **Conquering the Kubernetes World**: While I have a solid grasp of building robust services, the DevOps world presents a unique set of challenges. To become more proficient, I'm actively studying to get CKA and CKAD certifications.
- **Be a 100x engineer, not just 10x**: I aspire to be a positive influence on those around me. One way to achieve this is by writing effective documentations. I try to spend at least 10% of my time at work writing docs. I also love to read good docs (open for recommendations!).
- **Cultivating Empathy and Growth**: As I've worked with various individuals, I've realized that technical abilities alone aren't enough. I'm committed to becoming a more empathetic and well-rounded individual for my team.
