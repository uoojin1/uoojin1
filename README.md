# Hi, there!

My name is Eugene (or Yujin) and I'm a software developer currently living in Toronto, Canada üçÅ.

Right now I'm at [Included Health](https://includedhealth.com/) and we are on a mission to make health care better for everyone.

I've been upto quite a few things. See my full journey [here](JOURNEY.md)!

### Below are the things that I'm focusing on:

 **Deepening my Go expertise**: I'm eager to strengthen my foundation in Go and its ecosystem. If you have any recommendations for excellent resources please don't hesitate to share them.
- **Conquering the Kubernetes World**: While I have a solid grasp of building robust services, the DevOps world presents a unique set of challenges. To become more proficient, I'm actively studying to get CKA and CKAD certifications.
- **Becoming a 100x engineer, not just 10x**: I aspire to be a positive influence on those around me. One way how I think I can get there is by writing effective documentations. I try to spend at least 10% of my time at work writing docs. I also enjoy reading well thought out docs.
- **Being empathetic**: As I've worked with various individuals, I've realized that technical abilities alone aren't enough. I'm committed to becoming a more empathetic and well-rounded individual for my team.
