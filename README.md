# Hi, there!

My name is Eugene (also Yujin). I'm a software developer currently living in Toronto, Canada.

My journey began in 2013 when I started my Computer Engineering major at the University of Toronto. Back then, coding was a new frontier for me, but my natural inclination towards crafting things drew me closer to it. During my UofT years, I landed internships that opened my eyes to the daily life of a software engineer.

My first internship was at IBM, where I leveraged Java and JavaScript to write comprehensive tests for APIs and UIs. This experience provided a solid foundation, but I craved a more hands-on role with direct business impact.

Naturally, I chose a startup, [BioRender](https://www.biorender.com/), for my second internship. BioRender was a [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) backed startup with a lean 8-person team during their growth phase. Even as an intern, I played a critical role. I shipped features on a rapid release cycle (weekly/biweekly) and received immediate user feedback, solidifying my full-stack development skills (MERN stack) and fostering a strong connection to the product's impact.

To utilize my web full-stack skillset (MERN stack) after graduation, I joined [Nascent Digital](https://www.nascentdigital.com/). I contributed to various projects, primarily focused on [MyTelus](https://www.telus.com/my-telus). Here, I had the privilege of working alongside brilliant minds, especially the CTO. His approach to craftsmanship significantly influenced my development philosophy, which continues to be a core reason for my enjoyment of coding.

After a few years, I wanted to experience what it's like to work at a large tech company. I joined [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) as a backend engineer. Working in Uber contrasted my previous experiences. The massive codebase, numerous teams with highly specific projects offered valuable insights. While contributing to a globally used app holds significant impact, it wasn't the right fit for me.

After leaving Uber, I embarked on a personal project to rediscover the pure joy of coding. Collaborating with a small team, we explored various ideas, gathered user feedback, and prototyped with Flutter/Firebase. While the project ultimately didn't come to fruition due to unforeseen circumstances, I gained invaluable experience in guiding product direction, leading a team of engineers, and pushing myself to the limits as a product owner.

Today, I'm at [Included Health](https://includedhealth.com/) and we are on a mission to make health care better for everyone. I sought a role that allowed me to delve deeper into Golang (a language I love) and play a central role within a core team. The Orchestration Platform team within IncludedHealth's Infrastructure org perfectly aligns with these aspirations. Here in my team, we build a healthcare orchestration engine for other vertical teams. My manager's insights during our coffee chat ultimately sealed the deal. I'm excited to learn from him and the team.

Looking Ahead:

- **Deepening My Go Expertise**: I'm eager to strengthen my foundation in Go and its ecosystem. If you have any recommendations for excellent resources (e.g., reading materials, lectures), please don't hesitate to share them.
- **Conquering the Kubernetes World**: While I have a solid grasp of building robust services, the DevOps world presents a unique set of challenges. To become more proficient, I'm actively working through lectures and aiming for the CKA and CKAD certifications.
- **Becoming a Positive Force**: I aspire to be a positive influence on those around me. One way to achieve this is through effective documentation. Although I'm currently contributing to documentation at IncludedHealth, I recognize there's still much room for growth in this area.
- **Cultivating Empathy and Growth**: As I've worked with various individuals, I've realized that technical abilities alone aren't enough. I'm committed to becoming a more empathetic and well-rounded individual. If you have any book recommendations to help me on this journey, I'd love to hear them.
